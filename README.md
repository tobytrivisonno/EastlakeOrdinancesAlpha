# EastlakeOrdinancesAlpha

This is the alpha version of City Ordinances hosted here in GitHub and managed by Git revision control software.

# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide an open-source platform to manage the city ordinances.  The primary benefit for moving to this platform is so that changes to and issues with the ordinances can be clearly documented and discussed in a public manner.

The official and up-to-date version of the ordinances should be maintained in the master branch.  To propose amendments to the ordinances, the repository should be forked (if the modifications are done be another user) and a new branch should be created.  The branch name should include the year, section and a 1-3 word description of the change.  For example, the amendment of the City Charter to remove the Mandatory Referral provisions should be made in a branch titled "2015-charter-art8-mandatory-referral".  A pull request should then be made by the user for merging into the master branch of the official repository.  The pull request should contain as much information as possible, including links to any Council resolutions, Committee minutes and meeting audio recordings, etc.  Questions may be asked in the pull request, and should be answered here.
