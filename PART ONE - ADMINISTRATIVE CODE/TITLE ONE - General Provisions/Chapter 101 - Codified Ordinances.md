(a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)

(b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)

(c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except as provided in subsection (d) hereof:

(1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action taken thereunder;

(2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;

(3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

(4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the ordinance had not been repealed or amended.

(ORC 1.58)

## 101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

(a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)

(b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and the last numbers or letters are included.

(ORC 1.23)

## 101.06  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.

(a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)

(b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision, they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)

(c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.

(2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into simultaneous operation.

(1)   The object sought to be attained;

(2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;

(3)   The legislative history;

(4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws upon the same or similar subjects;

(5)   The consequences of a particular construction;

(6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
(ORC 1.49)

## 101.08  SEVERABILITY.

If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
